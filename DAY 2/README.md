## DAY 2. Arrays and Strings

- [String Compression](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%202/StringCompression.java)  
  *Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).*

- [Rotate Matrix](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%202/RotateMatrix.java)  
  *Given an image represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?*

- [Zero Matrix](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%202/ZeroMatrix.java)  
  *Write an algorithm such that if an element in an M x N matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.*

- [String Rotation](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%202/StringRotation.java)  
  *Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle " is a rotation of "erbottlewat").*
