## DAY 6. Trees and Graphs

List of tasks:

- [Validate BST](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%206/ValidateBST.java)  
  *Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.*

- [Successor](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%206/Successor.java)  
  *Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.*

- [Build Order](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%206/BuildOrder.java)  
  *You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects, where the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there is no valid build order, return an error.  
  __EXAMPLE:__  
  Input:  
    projects: a, b, c, d, e, f  
    dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)  
  Output: f, e, a, b, d, c*
