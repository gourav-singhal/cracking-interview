## DAY 7. Trees and Graphs

List of tasks:

- [First Common Ancestor](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%207/FirstCommonAncestor.java)  
  *Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.*  

- [BST Sequences](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%207/BSTSequences.java)  
  * A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element. Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.  
  __EXAMPLE:__
  Input: Tree with 2 in a root, 1 in a left node, 3 in a right node  
  Output: {2 , 1, 3}, {2 , 3, 1}*
