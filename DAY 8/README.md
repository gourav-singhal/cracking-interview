## DAY 8. Trees and Graphs

List of tasks:

- [Check Subtree](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%208/CheckSubtree.java)  
  *T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1 much bigger than T2. Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1. A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node N in T1 such that the subtree of N is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node N, the two trees would be identical*  

- [Random Node](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%208/RandomNode.java)  
  *You are implementing a binary search tree class from scratch, which, in addition to `insert`, `find`, and `delete`, has a method `getRandomNode()` which returns a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. Design and implement an algorithm for `getRandomNode`, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.*  

- [Paths with Sum](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%208/PathsWithSum.java)  
  *You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).*
